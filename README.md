# QuickNews-Summarizer-Automated-News-Article-Summarization-using-LexRank-Newspaper3k

QuickNews Summarizer is a Python-based NLP project that automatically creates short summaries of long news articles. The system takes a news article URL as input, extracts the full text using Newspaper3k, and applies the LexRank algorithm (a graph-based extractive summarization method) to generate a concise 5â€“6 sentence summary.

âœ¨ Key Features:
1. Real-time summarization from any online news link.
2. Reduces reading time by 60â€“70% while keeping main points intact.
3. Lightweight, fast, and easy to use with a simple GUI.
4. Works without large training datasets or heavy computation.

ðŸš€ Tech Stack: Python, NLP, Newspaper3k, LexRank (Sumy), Tkinter (GUI).

ðŸ”® Future Scope: Adding abstractive summarization (BERT, GPT, T5), multi-language support, and deployment as a web/mobile app.
